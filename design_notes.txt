Below is a draft user interface description (in order of "importance"):

SoC selection (drop down)
  DA14580
  DA14581
  DA14583
  DA14585 => First iteration, we will focus on this?
  DA14586
  DA14531
  -------

Power supply 
  Mode bypass/buck/boost (drop down)
  Voltage in context of supply mode and SoC (slider)

Peripheral/Central mode (no central in initial implementation?) (radio button)

Sleep mode (radio button)
  hibernation 
  Deep sleep
  Extended sleep  

Advertising
  Interval 100 - 4000 (slider)
  Data size 3-31 (slider)
  Connectable/Broadcast (radio button)
  Scan response none/3-31bytes (radio button + slider)
  Channels used 37/38/39 (at least one) (check box) 

Connection (make sure parameters stays within BT spec)
  Interval 7.5ms - 4s (note: some warnings about phone and OS)
  Slave latency 0-255 
  Read bytes per second
  Write bytes per second
  Notify bytes per second/interval?

FEM
  Prefilled Skyworks XML or custom (use SKY66112 as pattern)
    RF output dBm selection (slider simple 2nd order approximation for output to consumption?)
    Added current during RX (if LNA) 0-40mA (number)
    Added current during TX (if PA) 0-40mA (number)
    Added current at sleep 0 - 2000nA (number)

--------------------------------------- Other thoughts ------------------------

Live (running on target):
  Connection is shown live connected to PC
  Advertising is non connected press reset on target to reconnect (alert box on screen with instructions)?

New CodeLess commands required
  Notification timer with transmit bytes timer
  Current parameters
  Update parameters 
  Broadcast
  Scan request rejection
  Operation to run at disconnection (for central mode etc)
  hibernation and deep sleep

-------------------------------------- Calculations ---------------------------

Advertising power consumption:
  Pre: fixed time fixed current
  Post: fixed time fixed current
  Tx variable count variable time fixed current  (add FEM TX current + internal amplifier ) 
  Rx variable count variable time fixed current (add FEM RX current)

Connection power consumption:
  Pre: fixed time fixed current
  Post: fixed time fixed current
  Tx variable count variable time fixed current  (add FEM TX current + internal amplifier ) 
  Rx variable count variable time fixed current (add FEM RX current)
